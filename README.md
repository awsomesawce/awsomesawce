Sup. I'm Carl.  I like reading code and docs.

I'm currently a cybersecurity engineer in training at [University of Florida][UF]

- My favorite javascript/typescript engine is [Deno].
- My favorite editor is [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com)
- My favorite package manager for Windows is [`scoop`](https://scoop.sh), but [`winget`][winget] is nice.
- Favorite commandline cheatsheet utility is: `curl https://cht.sh/<search_term>`

<!--
- Favorite shells are [`pwsh`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell), [`nu`](https://www.nushell.sh), and [`zsh`](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/).
-->
- I enjoy using [Powershell][pwsh]; I find it intuitive and the module system is nice.
  - Another shell worth looking into is [nushell].  It implements some of the same concepts Powershell does but in a different way, and it's written in [Rust].
- Favorite markup language is [Github-flavored markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).
- Favorite markdown-to-html tool is [`pandoc`](https://pandoc.org).
- Favorite terminal git ui apps are [`lazygit`](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) and [`tig`](https://jonas.github.io/tig/).
- Favorite serialization file format is [Yaml](https://yaml.org/)
- I like [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org) over [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com)
- I like [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) over [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org), but it's memory-expensive.
- Favorite Linux package manager is [`pacman`][pm], which in turn makes [**ArchLinux**](https://archlinux.org/) my favorite distro.
- Favorite online IDE/Repl site is [Replit](https://repl.it). They have apps for both desktop and mobile and they're awesome and ergonomicly designed with **AI-suggestions built in**, etc.!


### TIP

**Arch Linux** is actually installable as a WSL Linux distro.  See [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#change-the-default-linux-distribution-installed).


I like writing [scripts](https://github.com/awsomesawce/my-python-scripts) [a](https://github/awsomesawce/my-dotfiles) [lot](https://github.com/awsomesawce/scripts-pwsh)


## Working On

Mainly experimenting with [`deno`](https://deno.land/std) and it's stdlib.

## Lessons I'm Learning

- **Newer**, although flashier, is _not_ always better.
- Redundancy is _rampant_ in the package manager world.  Sometimes it's best to just pick one tool or module and run with it rather than spending time weighing the pros and cons between multiple pieces of software.
  - Example: have you counted how many `grep` apps there are available?  Just use [ripgrep] and be done with it.

## In conclusion

Thanks for reading!  Hope we can collaborate on something in the near future!

## About Me

Sup. I'm a developer/programmer named Carl.

- My favorite javascript/typescript engine is [Deno](https://deno.land).
- My favorite editor is [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com)
- My favorite package manager for Windows is [`scoop`](https://scoop.sh), but [`winget`]() is getting better.
  - I believe `winget` makes `choco` obsolete.
- Favorite commandline cheatsheet utility is:

```bash
chtsh() {
if command -v curl > /dev/null; then
  curl "https://cht.sh/$*"
fi
```

- Favorite shells are [`pwsh`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell), [`nu`](https://www.nushell.sh), and [`zsh`](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/).
- Favorite markup language is [Github-flavoredMarkdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).
- Favorite markdown-to-html tool is [`pandoc`](https://pandoc.org).
- Favorite terminal git ui apps are [`lazygit`](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) and [`tig`](https://jonas.github.io/tig/).
- Favorite serialization file format is [Yaml](https://yaml.org/)
- I like [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org) over [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com)
- I like [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) over [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org), but it's memory-expensive.
- Favorite Linux package manager is [`pacman`], which in turn makes [**ArchLinux**](https://archlinux.org/) my favorite distro.
- Favorite online IDE/Repl site is [Replit](https://repl.it). They have apps for both desktop and mobile and they're _awsomesawce_.

### TIP

**Arch Linux** is actually installable as a WSL Linux distro.  See [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#change-the-default-linux-distribution-installed).


I like writing [scripts](https://github.com/awsomesawce/my-python-scripts) [a](https://github/awsomesawce/my-dotfiles) [lot](https://github.com/awsomesawce/scripts-pwsh)


## Working On

Mainly experimenting with [`deno`](https://deno.land/std) and it's stdlib.
